# Calcumate
An enthusiastic attempt at learning OOP concepts while extending a GNOME-like calculator to a complete math-package. The project is made to provide a handy calculator for student-level maths. Try out the cool features!

### Usage:
Run the calculator .py file
> python3 calculator.py

Delete the extra Math.txt afterwards

### How to use?
> After running the code as per usage, you will see 5 modes:
> 
> 1. **Basic**: BODMAS
> 2. **Advanced**: Trigonometry, Logarithmic and exponential calculations
> 3. **Integration Solver**: Just put in f(x), upper and lower limits, and sub-intervals (put 10 if not bothered about it), and get the definite integration!
> 4. **Polynomial Operator**: Put two polynomial expressions, and there are options for BODMAS and what not! Explore!
> 5. **Equation solver**: Extremely handy for solving simultaneous equations! Put in the number of variables and their coefficients, and get a fairly accurate solution!

### Future improvements:
> 1. A **Matrix** mode could be added for matrix operations as an additional functionality.
> 2. A better platform for the application could be searched upon; for now it's Tkinter!
> 3. Polynomial expression number could be extended.
